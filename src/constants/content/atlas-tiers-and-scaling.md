## Atlas Tiers and Scaling

Atlas offers different cluster tiers to accommodate various workloads:

* **Shared Clusters (M0, M2, M5):** Free and low-cost tiers with limited storage and compute power.
* **Dedicated Clusters (M10 and above):** Higher performance with dedicated resources.
* **Scaling Options:**
    * **Vertical Scaling:** Upgrading cluster size (RAM, CPU).
    * **Horizontal Scaling (Sharding):** Distributing data across multiple nodes for large-scale applications.
    * **Autoscaling:** Automatically adjusting cluster size based on workload demand.
