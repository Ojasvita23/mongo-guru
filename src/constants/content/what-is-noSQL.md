# **What is NoSQL?**

NoSQL databases are non-relational database systems designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data that don't fit well into traditional table-based relational database structures. They offer flexible schemas, horizontal scalability, and specialized data models for specific data types.

## **Key Characteristics of NoSQL Databases**

- **Schemaless** – Flexible schema design
- **Horizontal scaling** – Scales out rather than up
- **Distributed** – Spans across multiple servers
- **Designed for specific data models** – Supports Document, Key-Value, Column-Family, Graph
- **Typically sacrifice ACID transactions** – Focus on performance and scalability (**BASE properties**)

NoSQL databases are particularly well-suited for **big data applications**, **real-time web applications**, and scenarios where data structures might change frequently.
