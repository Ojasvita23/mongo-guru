# Schema Versioning Strategies

As applications evolve, document structures often need to change. Common schema versioning strategies include:

&nbsp;
### 1. Schema Version Field: Add a version field to each document to track which schema version it uses
&nbsp;

```javascript
{ schemaVersion: 1, name: "Product A", price: 9.99 }
{ schemaVersion: 2, name: "Product B", price: 19.99, categories: ["electronics"] }
```

&nbsp;
### 2. Incremental Migration: Update documents gradually during regular application operations
### 3. Immediate Migration: Update all documents at once when deploying a new schema (can be resource-intensive for large collections)
### 4. Hybrid Approach: Immediate migration for critical changes and incremental for others
### 5. Schema-less Approach: Design application code to handle multiple document structures simultaneously

&nbsp;
### When implementing schema changes, consider:

1. Backward compatibility for existing applications
2. Performance impact of migration operations
3. Downtime requirements during transitions
4. Data integrity throughout the migration process

&nbsp;
### Each strategy has trade-offs regarding complexity, performance impact, and application complexity.
