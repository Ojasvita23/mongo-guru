## $match and $project Stages

* $match: Filters documents based on specified criteria, similar to the `find()` method's query syntax. It reduces the number of documents for processing in subsequent stages.

* $project: Reshapes documents by including, excluding, or transforming fields. You can create new fields, modify existing ones, or remove fields you don't need.
