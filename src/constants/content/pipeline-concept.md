The MongoDB Aggregation Framework is a powerful tool for data processing and analysis.
It allows you to transform and analyze data using a pipeline of stages. Here's an
explanation of the key concepts:

## Pipeline Concept

The aggregation pipeline is a series of data processing stages where the output of one stage
becomes the input for the next. Each stage performs a specific operation on the data. This
pipeline approach allows for complex transformations and calculations in a structured,
sequential manner.
