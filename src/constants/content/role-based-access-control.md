## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is an approach to restricting system access based on roles within an organization:

* Users are assigned roles based on their job functions
* Roles are assigned permissions based on the actions needed for those functions
* Users acquire permissions through their assigned roles
* This creates a more manageable security model than assigning permissions directly to users

RBAC provides better security by adhering to the principle of least privilege, reduces administrative work, and simplifies compliance auditing.
