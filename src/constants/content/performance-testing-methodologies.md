## Performance Testing Methodologies

Regular testing ensures optimal database performance.

* **Load Testing:** Simulate high-traffic scenarios.
    * Example: Using Apache JMeter to test 1,000 concurrent users.
* **Stress Testing:** Push system to its limits to identify failures.
* **Profiling Queries:** Use tools like MySQL Slow Query Log or PostgreSQL pg_stat_statements to find slow queries.
