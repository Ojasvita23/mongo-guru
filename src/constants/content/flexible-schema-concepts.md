# Flexible Schema Concepts

MongoDB is a document-oriented database with a flexible schema, meaning that documents within the same collection can have different fields. This differs from traditional relational databases where tables have a fixed structure.

## Key advantages include:
- No need to define a schema upfront
- Easy adaptation to changing data requirements
- Ability to store heterogeneous data in the same collection
- Natural representation of hierarchical or complex data structures

### While MongoDB offers this flexibility, many applications benefit from maintaining some consistency in document structure, implementing what's often called "schema on read" versus the traditional "schema on write" approach.
