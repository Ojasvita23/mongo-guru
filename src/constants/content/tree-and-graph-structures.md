## Tree and Graph Structures

* **Trees**: Hierarchical structures where each node has one parent (except root)
    * *Example*: File systems, organizational charts
    * *Implementation*: Parent references, child references, materialized paths, nested sets

* **Graphs**: Networks where nodes can connect to any number of other nodes
    * *Example*: Social networks, recommendation systems
    * *Implementation*: Adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, specialized graph databases
