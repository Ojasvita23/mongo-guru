## Performance Considerations

Transactions come with performance overhead, so it's important to understand:

* Impact on read/write performance
* Lock contention and how it affects concurrent operations
* Transaction size and duration limitations
* Monitoring and optimization strategies
* When to use transactions versus when simpler operations would suffice
