## ACID Properties in MongoDB

MongoDB transactions support ACID properties:

* **Atomicity:** All operations in a transaction either complete successfully or have no effect.
* **Consistency:** Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another.
* **Isolation:** Transactions are isolated from each other until they're committed.
* **Durability:** Once committed, transaction results are permanent, even in the event of a system failure.
