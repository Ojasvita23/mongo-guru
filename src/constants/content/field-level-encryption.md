## Field Level Encryption

Field Level Encryption protects specific data fields within a database or document:

* Encrypts sensitive data (e.g., SSNs, credit card numbers) while leaving other fields unencrypted
* Allows fine-grained access control to encrypted fields
* Protects data even if the database is compromised
* Enables searching and sorting on unencrypted fields while maintaining security for sensitive data
* Typically uses symmetric encryption algorithms with secure key management
