## External Authentication

External authentication delegates the authentication process to a third-party identity provider:

* Allows integration with existing identity management systems
* Supports various authentication protocols like SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect
* Reduces the need to manage user credentials directly
* Provides a single point for enforcing authentication policies
* Examples include integrations with Active Directory, Google Workspace, or dedicated identity providers like Okta or Auth0
* Simplifies user management and improves security by centralizing authentication
