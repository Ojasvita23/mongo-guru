Replication in MongoDB creates redundant copies of your data across multiple servers, providing high availability, automatic failover, and data safety. Let's explore the key concepts in detail:

## Replica Set Architecture

A MongoDB replica set consists of multiple MongoDB instances that maintain the same data set. A typical replica set contains:

* One primary node that receives all write operations
* Multiple secondary nodes that replicate the primary's data
* Optionally, arbiter nodes that participate in elections but don't store data

Replica sets typically have an odd number of members (e.g., 3, 5, or 7) to ensure proper voting during elections. The minimum recommended production deployment is 3 members.
