# Document Size Limitations

MongoDB has a maximum BSON document size of 16 megabytes. This limit ensures efficient data handling and prevents performance issues. For larger data, MongoDB provides GridFS, which breaks files into smaller chunks stored as separate documents.

## Other practical considerations include:
- Network transmission overhead for large documents
- Memory usage implications when loading documents
- Query performance effects when documents contain unnecessary data

&nbsp;
### Best practice is to keep documents reasonably sized and focused on related data that is typically accessed together.
