## Transport Encryption (TLS/SSL)

Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypt data in transit:

* Creates a secure channel between two communicating systems
* Provides data confidentiality and integrity
* Uses certificate-based authentication to verify server identities
* Prevents eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery
* Uses a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption

Modern systems typically use TLS 1.2 or 1.3, as older versions have security vulnerabilities.
