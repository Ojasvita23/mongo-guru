## Client-Side Field Level Encryption

This is a specific implementation of field level encryption where encryption happens on the client before data is sent to the server:

* Sensitive data is encrypted by the client application before transmission
* The server never sees the unencrypted data
* Encryption keys are managed on the client side and never shared with the server
* Provides protection against compromised servers and insider threats
* Reduces the scope of compliance requirements for the server environment
