## Replica Set Security

Security considerations for replica sets include:

* **Internal Authentication:** Using keyfiles or x.509 certificates for member authentication
* **TLS/SSL:** Encrypting communication between replica set members
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Configuring appropriate user roles for replication
* **Network Segmentation:** Placing replica set members in secure network zones
* **Credentials Rotation:** Regularly updating keyfiles and certificates
