## Hardware Considerations

The right hardware setup improves database performance.

* **More RAM:** Allows more data to be stored in memory, reducing disk access.
* **CPU Cores:** More cores help handle parallel query execution.
* **RAID Configurations:** RAID 10 provides a balance between performance and redundancy.
