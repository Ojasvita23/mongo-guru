## Monitoring Sharded Clusters

Effective monitoring involves tracking:

* **Chunk distribution:** Even distribution prevents hotspots.
* **Balancer activity:** Excessive migrations impact performance.
* **Jumbo chunks:** Chunks too large to migrate require manual intervention.
* **Connection counts:** High connection counts may indicate need for more mongos routers.
* **Query targeting:** Track if queries are using the shard key effectively.

MongoDB provides commands and utilities for monitoring:

* `sh.status()`: Overview of sharding status.
* `db.stats()`: Collection-level statistics.
* MongoDB Atlas or Ops Manager: Visual monitoring tools.
