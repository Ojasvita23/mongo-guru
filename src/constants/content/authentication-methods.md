## Authentication Methods

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users or systems. Common methods include:

* **Password-based:** Traditional username/password combinations, often with additional requirements like complexity rules and periodic changes
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Combines multiple verification methods (something you know, have, or are)
* **Certificate-based:** Uses digital certificates for identity verification
* **Biometric:** Fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, etc.
* **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Allows users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials
* **OAuth/OpenID Connect:** Standards for authorization and authentication between services
